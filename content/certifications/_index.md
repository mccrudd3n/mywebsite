## *Forever Learning - 184 Sqn*
A motto etched into my core as an Air Cadet.
The more I learn, the deeper I value it.

Education comes from the Latin root word **Educo** which derived from the combinations of *ex-* [out of] and *ducere* [to lead or guide], conveying the sense of *"To Lead out"* or *"To Draw Forth"*. This reflects the idea of education as the process of **drawing out knowledge from within a person**.  

This page is a reflection of that belief.
Each certification I’ve earned isn’t a trophy, but a checkpoint on a self-driven journey; signposts along a road powered by curiosity. They don’t define the destination; they illuminate the path.

My studies—spanning Science and Engineering, Project Management, Business, and beyond—may seem scattered across disciplines. But look closer, and you’ll find a single thread running through them all: a restless curiosity that connects and strengthens every skill, proving that with purpose and persistence, even the most diverse fields can move in harmony.

I am greatly thankful to have the ability to subscribe to [coursera]('https://www.coursera.org/user/6d45c981787f06a66f195eec4c15b8d6') and regularly study my passion!
