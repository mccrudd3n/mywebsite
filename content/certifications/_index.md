## Overview

I’ve organised my credentials into focus areas so you can jump straight to the skills that matter most—cloud, analytics, leadership, and more. Each card links to a dedicated page with the story behind the badge, proof of completion, and the impact on my work.

Use the section headings below to skim by domain, or head directly to a certificate if you already know what you’re looking for.
