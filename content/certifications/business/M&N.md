## Self-Reflection: The Art of the (*Almost*) Deal

*“You don’t just buy a company—you buy a future. And futures are built on assumptions, risks, and trust.”*

This **Mergers & Acquisitions Portfolio** is more than credentials—it’s **battle-tested ambition**.  
It begins with formal training from the **New York Institute of Finance**, but its soul was forged at **age 21**, leading a **£3.5M acquisition attempt** in precision engineering for Oil & Gas.

I’ve always lived by one rule: **buy low, sell high**. Shoes. Vape liquid. Gadgets. Whatever moved.  
Then I discovered **[Dan Peña](https://www.danpena.co.uk/qla-for-dummies/)**—the QLA prophet screaming, *“Just f*cking do it!”*  
His gospel? **M&A is the fastest path to quantum wealth.**

I didn’t want to wait 30 years to build. I wanted to **acquire**.

No Ivy League. No trust fund. Just **online rigor** via the **National Registry of CPE Sponsors**.  
I absorbed the **full M&A playbook**:
- **Valuation**: DCF, multiples, precedent deals  
- **Risk layers**: financial, operational, legal, cultural  
- **Structuring**: cash vs. stock, earn-outs, anti-embarrassment clauses  
- **Regulatory gauntlet**: antitrust, CFIUS, SEC  
- **Synergies**: the 1+1=3 myth—and how to make it real  

I didn’t just learn the *what*. I learned the *why* behind every clause.

### The War Room: Age 21, £3.5M on the Line

I **built the NXD dream team**:  
- Chairman (ex-industry titan)  
- CFO (numbers ninja)  
- COO (operations beast)  
- 3 PhDs in precision gearing, advanced materials, and production systems  

We had:
- LOI signed  
- Due diligence 80% complete  
- Synergies mapped  
- Funding sources lined up  
- My shoes polished, shirt ironed, **Windsor knot perfect**

At **21**, I was in the room where it happens. I **led the charge**.

**We didn’t close.**

The seller wanted **£3.5M in a black leather duffle bag**—cash today, no earn-out, no performance clause. Fair valuation? **£2.5M max.** Greed replaced logic.

So I made the call. I walked. **Unchained.**

### The Lessons That Stuck

- **Knowledge without capital is theory.**  
- **A great team beats a great idea.**  
- **Due diligence is where deals die—or are reborn.**  
- **You don’t need permission. You need preparation.**

That near-miss wasn’t failure. It was **my Harvard**.
Every course, every model, every simulation…  
**is prep for the next room**.

### Why M&A?

Because **empires aren’t built—they’re acquired**.

And next time?  
**I close.**
