## Born to Fly, Built to Engineer

*“Engineering isn’t a hobby. It’s a lifestyle. It’s a mindset. From Lego bricks to lifting bodies—this is my flight plan.”*

This **Aircraft Engineering & Design Portfolio** is **my logbook** from **age 13 in RAF Air Cadets** to earning a **BEng (Hons)** while still smelling of jet fuel! - Going to the petrol station just isn’t the same! 

I learned to **fly before I could drive** even though my nickname was *Vomit comet* and I’ve been chasing altitude in different ways ever since!

### Age 13: RAF Air Cadets – The Launchpad

Joined the **Air Training Corps (RAF Air Cadets)** at 13.  
Not for the uniform. For the **sky**. I am glad the my father one day took us to our local Squadron and join! 

- **First flight**: Glider, Powered flight and Aerobatics at the of age 14  
- **First attempted ghost-solo**: Powered aircraft, **age 16** — *way before my driving test* - I do have to say, due to my air-sickness, I didn’t pass my test after letting go of the control column just before touching the ground causing the aircraft to hit a hard landing and ballon bouncing on the runway along with the instructor *lightly* screaming at me...

- Several ground school: **principles of flight, navigation, engines**  
- Regular visits to **RAF bases** (Lossiemouth, Leuchars, Cranwell so many more) and **airshows** (RIAT, Farnborough)  
- Hands-on: stripping piston engines, reading schematics, pre-flight checks  

*I wasn’t just learning to fly. I was learning **why** things fly!*

### High School: Engineering Diploma

Dual-track:
- **Theory**: Mechanics, Electrics, materials,  
- **Practice**: Wood/Metal work, Lathe work, welding, technical drawing   
- **Transcripts**: Two years of graded projects—*designing an early warning forest fire detection system using Bluetooth/WIFI interconnected mesh network*

This wasn’t extra credit. This was **proof of craft**!

### University: BEng (Hons) Aircraft Engineering

Some modules were:
- **Advanced Aircraft Performance** 
- **Aircraft Design** – wing loading, stability, control surfaces, systems integration  
- **Propulsion Systems** – gas turbines, reciprocating engines, performance mapping  
- **Avionics & Flight Control**
- **Engineering Project Management**
- **Workshop Mastery** – fabricated components to **EASA tolerances**  

Graduated with **industry-ready skills** and a tool bag of skills!

### Why Aircraft Engineering?

It isn’t passion. It’s an obsession!
