## From Lego to Launch Vehicles
*“Engineering isn’t a hobby. It’s a lifestyle. It’s a mindset.”*

This **CAD Portfolio** is where it all began—**night classes after collage**, fuelled by nothing but curiosity and a love for turning ideas into geometry.

Since I was a child, my parents somewhat saw and gracefully nurtured my Engineering mindset, building since I could hold a brick! from **Lego → Knex -> Meccano → Sketchpads → AutoCAD.**

While others were out on Friday nights, I took extra college lab courses, learning **layer standards**, **dimensioning**, and **how to make a 2D line carry a 3D future**. These weren’t mandatory courses. They were **electives for the soul**!

Three certificates within two years’ worth of night classes to **master the digital drafting board**.

#### 1. **[2D Computer Aided Design 09/2012](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nIdZOHQZYJK5ofzBdTINmb-zjk56AiH8/view?usp=sharing)**  
- Precision linework  
- ISO-compliant drawings  
- Blocks, hatches, annotations  
> *The grammar of engineering communication.*

#### 2. **[2D Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing 09/2012](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15nmfQJkbbLrOv43kXTc7cLy5oJI4EDQJ/view?usp=sharing)**  
- From screen to spindle  
- Exporting to CNC  
- Understanding toolpaths  
> *Where design meets reality.*

#### 3. **[Advanced CAD Using AutoCAD (Level 3)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CfDu51COUU3QoyEOreo4D_jYh7_e5PHD/view?usp=sharing)**
- 3D wireframes & surfaces  
- Complex assemblies  
- Custom lisp routines  
> *The moment CAD became a superpower.*

### The Mindset That Stuck

- **Precision is non-negotiable.**  
- **Every line has a purpose.**  
- **The drawing is the contract between idea and object.**

These night classes weren’t about a grade. They were about **earning the right to build** with industry experts around me also learning to improve and localise their skills. This was **ground zero**, the foundation for everything that followed—FEA, CFD and allowed me to control and manage the CAD/CAM section of a precision glass manufacturing company. I collected all customer drawings, planned all job lines to maximise machine cutting time and reduce waste through highly controlled Kerf Management - I’ve been drawing the future since 2012 and this was a walk in the park! – Thank you past self for that decision!
