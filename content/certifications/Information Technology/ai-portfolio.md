## Self-Reflection

In an era where **generative AI is reshaping knowledge work**, this course was a revelation—both technically and philosophically. Learning to *command* models like **DALL·E**, **Stable Diffusion**, **Synthesia**, and **ChatGPT** felt like rediscovering the internet in 2005: *prompt engineering is the new Google-fu*.

Each technique—**Chain-of-Thought**, **Tree-of-Thought**, **Interview Pattern**—was a lesson in precision. It’s not just *asking*—it’s **orchestrating intelligence**. I laughed realising: *I’ve been prompt engineering my whole life— From google search bar to now with neural networks.*

This Professional Certificate equipped me to:
- **Enhance visualisations** using AI-generated assets and insights  
- **Impute missing data** with statistically coherent synthetic points  
- **Accelerate testing** via AI-driven scenario generation  
- **Navigate ethics** in automated decision-making  

I explored tools like **IBM watsonx Prompt Lab**, **Spellbook**, and **Dust**, and passed all graded quizzes and the final exam—proof that I don’t just *use* AI, I *direct* it.

This is the first of several AI-focused certifications I’ll showcase here (others, like **IBM AI Project Management**, live under leadership themes). Together, they form a mosaic: **from code to cognition, from data to decisions.**

The future isn’t just automated—it’s *co-created*. And I’m ready to write the prompts.
