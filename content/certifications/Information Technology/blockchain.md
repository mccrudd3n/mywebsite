## Self-Reflection

Studying blockchain since 2017 marks the pinnacle of my transition from mechanical and electrical engineering to software and IT. The intertwined evolution of hardware and software continues to captivate me to this day. My father nurtured this passion in my siblings and I from an early age—I still remember our first mobile phone, a Sony Ericsson, and at just 13, discovering torrent sites like LimeWire to download Linkin Park tracks.

When I first learned about **blockchain**—a system that prevents digital duplication—I was sceptical. *Surely someone will crack it, just like those encrypted DVDs. It’s only a matter of time.*

That curiosity drove me to countless YouTube videos. To my surprise, blockchain offered far more than security. It was a gateway to decentralized systems, smart contracts, and a new paradigm of trust in digital infrastructure.

One standout innovation: **atomic flash loans**, which allow borrowing unlimited capital for a single transaction block—*zero collateral, zero risk*—provided the loan is repaid in full within the same block. This enforces 100% opportunity cost: profit if conditions are met, automatic reversion if not - WHAT? The questions I keep asking myself is "How can I leverage this information!"

As of this writing, I’ve invested in several paid learning platforms and earned certifications in blockchain development, cryptography, and decentralized applications. **Was it worth it?** Absolutely. The structured knowledge, hands-on projects, and practical insights have been invaluable—far beyond what free resources alone could provide.

This journey isn’t just technical; it’s personal. From childhood curiosity sparked by a clunky flip phone to building on-chain solutions today, technology has been the thread connecting past and future.
