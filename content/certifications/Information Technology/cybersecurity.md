## Self-Reflection

Studying blockchain sparked deep concerns about **privacy, security, and anonymity**. *Is my system safe? Am I being tracked? Cookies everywhere!*

The more I learned, the more the paradox of knowledge gripped me—until I read Shoshana Zuboff’s *[The Age of Surveillance Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Surveillance_Capitalism)*. That was the tipping point. I deleted my digital footprint, severed online connections with friends and family, and chose to *go ghost*.

With no mentor but my own curiosity, I felt lost in a vast sea of knowledge - drifting unmoored in a sea of pages. Yet this isolation became a crucible for growth. I retreated with my partner, traveling, immersing in nature, and striving to live fully in *the now* while studying in silence.

Now the pendulum swings back. Through data analysis and a renewed trust in technology’s potential for good, I’m rebuilding with the determination to create something meaningful. But that raises an existential question: **Who defines right and wrong in a world built on code?**
