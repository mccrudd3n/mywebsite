## Self Reflection

After the completion of IBM's AI Project Manager course, I have an urge to understand this technology at a deeper level. Could I possibly build one myself? Could I provide a service which will support the planet? with the rise of Artificial Intelligence it has really sparked my curiosity with its potential to change the world which means; *I needed/had to/must look under the hood.* 

During the course, I came to the realisation of indirectly fostering data analytical skill through the study of computational fluid dynamics as well as finite element analysis at university.

In a short few words:
- Create a hypothesis then draft a plan of action  
- Collection data to prove or break that hypothesis
- Analyse/construct in order to evaluate the data collected
- Present and evaluate the findings   

It is very interesting to logically build a repeatable data workflow/pipeline from cleaning, processing then analysis, after which converted into a story/presentation to support the best-case decision. 

This knowledge and profound wisdom would have been really helpful when I was at university to support my ability to analyse the vast computation fluid dynamics and finite element data - it’s only a few years late- hahahaha. 

## Next steps

During the time at which I completed this course, I found myself in deep though with building my own model and how to do just that – I understand the concept of analysing data, creating a pipeline to explore, organise and build visual results after this course however this course provided lessons about using the product than building tensors for example. 
I did fall into a deep though with regards to maths as being the language of the universe which I really believe, looking up to infinity and looking down to infinity sometimes leaves me with such an awe feeling though it is so interesting that this has all derived through maths. 
Building my model for an unknown job is still what I am looking into and at the time, the Google Advanced Data Analytics has caught my eye
