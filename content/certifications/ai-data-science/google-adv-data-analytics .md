## Self Reflection

Is it me or are we trying to measure the butterfly of the universe? Hear me out…
-	**Data is a unit of measure with respect to time. Tracking an objects historic behaviour to measures/predicts the potential ripple effects on another other object/s.** 

I have found myself in deep self-reflection as I build my “second brain”. Steve Jobs once said something like “You can only connect the dots looking backward” or from my view, through self-reflection you can see the interconnectedness of what you have done. 

I am at that point- trying to connect the dots. Data has become more than just a point in an XYZ Grid. Isolated Data just represents number but data that has been put together properly tells a story, and understanding the story could help prediction the next move of that butterfly – It really seems like we are trying to track and trace the random butterfly of the universe right now.

## Next steps
At this moment in time, I am currently learning Genomic Data Analysis. DNA is such an interesting platform; I mean it is technically a computer, right? In some shape of form since it does handle data though its in ATGC molecular bond. 
  
Now why…why Genetic data analysis you ask? Well working for a company which pioneers in poultry genetics has somewhat *guided* me to take that path, through the large data collection, labelling and understanding poultry management which includes genomic data collection through different teams. This has sparked my interest to peak under the carpet, I am not sure if this is a tango dance of one step forward and two steps back. Nonetheless, does this fit my aims and objective. I strongly believe so! 

P.S Selective "natural" breading through the use of genomic data as the key factor - crazy if you ask me.
