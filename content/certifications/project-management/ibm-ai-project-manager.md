## Self Reflection

With LLMs exponential growth within the market as well as its new and unknown ways of potential use-cases, this course has provided generative AI concepts such as prompt engineering, idea life cycle as well as fundamental principles of product management. 
I found it very interesting and even amusing whilst learning prompt engineering, this reminded me of the days when I learnt how to use google! learning how to specifically ask or should I say *search* for the right information! 

## Next steps

This Technology is very interesting, the ability to now generate content and to leverage its use case has really left me to ponder; is it possible to build my own? if so how!? 

At the time of completing this course I wasn’t so sure and was somewhat lost with what to do however, I now know from the course that LLMs are built through models. with that in mind, I have decided to start the IBM Data Science in order to gain a deeper understanding. Looking back at this as I build this website after the Google Advanced data analytics. I am quite proud of my persistence and now truly have a better understanding of the potential.
