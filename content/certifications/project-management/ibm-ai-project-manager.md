## Self-Reflection: From Prompt to Product

The more I learn, the more I realise that LLMs aren’t just tools—they act more like teammates. And someone has to lead the team. Its an interesting mental shift from *“Wow, this generates content/image!”* to *“How can I ship value at scale?”* - IBM's AI Project Management delivered the **full-stack playbook**.

| Course | Key Takeaway |
|-------|--------------|
| **Product Management Foundations** | Stakeholder mapping, MVP definition, success metrics |
| **AI Product Strategy & Planning** | Vision → backlog → sprint zero |
| **Generative AI: Intro & Applications** | From GANs to LLMs—when to use what |
| **Prompt Engineering Basics** | **Chain-of-Thought**, **Interview Pattern**, precision prompting |
| **Foundation Models & Platforms** | OpenAI, Anthropic, IBM watsonx—deployment trade-offs |
| **Building AI-Powered Products** | Hands-on: DALL·E image gen, ChatGPT workflow automation |
| **Supercharge Your PM Career with GenAI** | AI as co-pilot in roadmapping, user research, A/B testing |

This course didn’t just teach prompts, it was helpful in teaching how to productize intelligence which is such an interesting way of leveraging knowledge.

### Why AI Product Management you ask?

From my perspective, AI doesn’t disrupt industries - **Products do.** And harnessing through understanding the potential usecase; not only in a generative way, but in a product management way could potentailly increase productivity to build a product.
