## Self-Reflection

*“Leadership isn’t taught in classrooms. It’s earned in the mud, on 2 hours of sleep, with 40kg on your back and 7 lives depending on your next order.”*

This **Junior Leaders Course (JL14)** wasn’t a course. It was selection, survival, and command. This was the **highest leadership qualification in the RAF Air Cadets**. This course broke me to built me and for that, I am eternally grateful to all QJL and staff for everything. 

The course ran from September to Easter with over 120 cadets and only **58 finishing**. I am proud to say that I was one.

### Selection: The First Filter
Weekend 1:
- **1.5-mile run**, press-ups, sit-ups — *pass or go home*  
- Leadership tasks, personal presentation, fieldcraft exam  
- Interview with **Squadron Leader**, OC Junior Leaders  
- Sunday: **squad endurance run** — no clock, just endurance

### Phase 1: Theory Meets Sweat
Core leadership doctrine:
- **Command tasks** — issue orders, receive fire  
- **Time management** — 5-minute warnings, 30-second executions  
- **Fitness escalation** — shave seconds off runs, add reps  
Outside the wire:  
- Memorized **orders format**, **battle procedure**, **patrol reports**  
- Trained solo — hill sprints in boots, running in my local park rucksack full of dead weight   
*The workload crushed time. But I adapted.*

### Phase 2: Tactical Reality
No more classrooms.
- **Tactical living** — cook, sleep, shit in the field  
- **Blank fire**, **smoke grenades**, **section attacks**  
- **Patrol types**: fighting, recce, ambush, clearance  

We moved as **sections of 8**.  
I rotated:  
- **Section Commander** — plan, brief, lead  
- **2IC** — manage ammo, casualties, comms  
- **Rifleman** — execute, adapt, survive  
*This was when the course became legendary.*

### Test Phase: 10 Days, 7 in the Field – STANTA
The final crucible
- **7-day continuous ops** — Deployed into STANTA; Aka Stanford Training Area, by Merlin Helicopters: Blood pumping, rifles shooting blanks and getting into cover as soon as we land!
- **<3 hours sleep total some nights**  
- **Missions**:  
  - Squadron-level night assault  
  - Seize and hold a **FOB**  
  - Fighting In Built Up Area (FIBUA)
  - Building clearance under fire   
  - 10km speed march, **40kg kit**, whilst sleep deprived.  

**Day 7**:  
Final **squadron assault** — live blanks, Flare Parachute, smoke; it was the best firework show I ever **felt**. We **cleared the objective**. Marched **back to camp** — full kit.

*I hurt everywhere. But I was grinning.*

### Graduation: RAF Honington Officer’s Mess

- **Hot shower**. First in a week.  
- **Real food**. Not rat-pack.  
- **Debrief**: **Passed.”**  
- **Dinner with the legends** — Qualified JLs, staff in a room filled with the finest silver wear and the RAF band playing for us.  
  
I still wear that mental badge like armour with honour.
