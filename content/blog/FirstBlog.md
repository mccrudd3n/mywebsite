## Key Takeaways

- Just do it
- Perfection = Paralysis 
- Thanks [ChuckNetwork](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck) You have supported me through your videos in more ways that you can think! 

## Introduction
My Second brain. In simple terms, im just doing it and I will make this into my small public portfolio! Thanks Chuck.

I am addicted to learning about my craft. Improving myself and keeping this brain alive! This is the first of many posts which I aim to showcase my work.

Now i did follow Chucks video at the start but i found it way too complex with getting obsidian to sync with hugo then upload to git and one thing that I have learnt in engineering is to keep it simple and perfection = paralysis. if the engineers would control the business side of things, no cars would leave the production line. 

In saying that I have made it very simple. Git syncing with my VScode. Git push, commit and done. 

Quick and Simple. 

P.S This isnt ment to be perfect nor it is ment to be.
