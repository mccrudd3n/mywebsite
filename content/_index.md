Welcome! This site is built with Hugo and fed by an Obsidian-driven writing workflow. Use the navigation bar to jump into the projects you are shipping, certifications you have achieved, the journal chronicling day-to-day progress, and notes about what you are currently learning.

The sections below surface the latest items from each area so readers can dive straight into recent updates.
