TLDR: Insanity is defined through the hope of change without changing any varables.

My Second brain. In simple terms, im just doing it and I will make this into my small public portfolio! Thanks ChuckNetwork!

I am addicted to learning about my craft. Improving myself and keeping this brain alive! This is the first of many posts which I aim to showcase my work.

Now i did follow Chucks video at the start but i found it way too complex with getting obsidian to sync with hugo then upload to git and one thing that I have learnt in engineering is to keep it simple and perfection = paralysis. if the engineers would control the business side of things, no cars would leave the production line. 

In saying that I have made it very simple. Git syncing with my VScode. Git push, commit and done, I did add a few photos behind to make this look abit nicer but it seems like this might be a waste of time right now so I will priorities this later one once I have some for of a structure. 

Quick and Simple. 
Credit to ChuckNetwork for the insperation

P.S This isnt ment to be perfect nor it is ment to be.

Layout improvement, Slowly including personal information such as certifications which I am happy to present. 

As Journals, this format seems to be working for me. Commiting and commenting under each journal until that is completed; in saying that, will the setup be ever completed since this is something that i will always change with respect to time?

Steve Jobs once said - You can only connect the dots looking backwards, or something alomg those line. AS i create this second brain it came to me in such a profound way; Data is more than just numbers on the screen, it really does tell a story and if I can try and understand that story then i could potentially predict what is about to happen since I am gaining an understanding of its historic past...well thats what it seems like it.

As a short note, though the log book is added at the bottom on "The Setup", in some cases im thinking of writing the latest logs from the top so that you the reader can read down than read up by scrolling up! Maybe for the next Journal once I have sorted out the basic layout of this thing. Plus i sort of want the very first log right at the top to give where created it due!
