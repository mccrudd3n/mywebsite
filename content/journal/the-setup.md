TLDR: Insanity is defined through the hope of change without changing any varables.

My Second brain. In simple terms, im just doing it and I will make this into my small public portfolio! Thanks ChuckNetwork!

I am addicted to learning about my craft. Improving myself and keeping this brain alive! This is the first of many posts which I aim to showcase my work.

Now i did follow Chucks video at the start but i found it way too complex with getting obsidian to sync with hugo then upload to git and one thing that I have learnt in engineering is to keep it simple and perfection = paralysis. if the engineers would control the business side of things, no cars would leave the production line. 

In saying that I have made it very simple. Git syncing with my VScode. Git push, commit and done, I did add a few photos behind to make this look abit nicer but it seems like this might be a waste of time right now so I will priorities this later one once I have some for of a structure. 

Quick and Simple. 
Credit to ChuckNetwork for the insperation

P.S This isnt ment to be perfect nor it is ment to be.

Layout improvement, Slowly including personal information such as certifications which I am happy to present. 

As Journals, this format seems to be working for me. Commiting and commenting under each journal until that is completed; in saying that, will the setup be ever completed since this is something that i will always change with respect to time?
