# Project Roadmap

## Vision
Create a visually engaging, content-rich personal website that is easy to maintain and showcases professional achievements, certifications, and thought leadership.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1 — Foundation
- Choose framework (Astro vs. Next.js) and bootstrap project.
- Implement core layout: header, footer, typography scales, color theme.
- Add basic pages: Home, Projects, Certifications, Blog (placeholder content).
- Configure ESLint, Prettier, and base GitHub Actions workflow for linting.

### Milestone 2 — Content Infrastructure
- Define content schema for projects, certifications, and blog posts.
- Set up MD/MDX parsing and frontmatter validation.
- Build reusable UI components for cards, timeline, and article layout.
- Integrate site metadata (SEO tags, Open Graph, RSS feed).

### Milestone 3 — Dynamic Features
- Add project filters (tech stack, year) and detail pages.
- Implement certification verification links and optional badge embeds.
- Create blog index with tag filters, search, and pagination if needed.
- Configure image optimization pipeline.

### Milestone 4 — Polish & Automation
- Add global analytics (e.g., Plausible or Google Analytics).
- Implement contact form (Formspree or serverless function).
- Set up deployment workflow (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel).
- Write onboarding docs for adding new content via Markdown + PR workflow.

## Open Questions
- Preferred hosting provider and domain setup requirements.
- Desired design direction (custom design vs. leveraging an existing theme).
- Accessibility standards and performance targets.
- Estimate for blog post publication cadence and editorial workflow.

## Next Steps
1. Decide on the framework and hosting strategy.
2. Formalize the initial content list (projects, certifications, posts).
3. Begin implementing Milestone 1 tasks in the selected framework.
